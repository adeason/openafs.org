# OpenAFS Newsletter, Volume 2, Issue 4, April 2010

Welcome to the twelveth issue of the OpenAFS newsletter. This newsletter
summarizes what is happening in the OpenAFS community.

As always, volunteers, patches, bug reports, or any other type of help is
greatly appreciated.

Feedback on this newsletter is welcome. The goal is to summarize the
various development efforts and news of OpenAFS for the community. Please
let Jason Edgecombe <jason@rampaginggeek.com> know what you would like to
see out of this newsletter. Any news about AFS-related projects is welcome
and may be submitted to Jason for inclusion in the next newsletter.

The current and past issues of this newsletter are available at
[http://www.openafs.org/newsletter/](http://www.openafs.org/newsletter/)

## General OpenAFS Progress

OpenAFS version 1.5.73 was released on March 24. It was followed by three
point releases to fix some issues. The latest version is 1.5.73.3. The
gatekeepers are asking for people to really start testing the 1.5.x
releases on Unix machines to help iron out bugs before 1.6. To help people
with the testing efforts, Russ Allbery has uploaded new Debian packages:

I've uploaded Debian packages of 1.5.73.3 plus some additional recent
patches to Debian experimental.  I should be able to keep the packages up
to date with subsequent 1.5.x releases going forward.

Due to the new libkopenafs1 package, the upload will have to go through
NEW, so it will be a little bit before they show up in Debian.

\--Russ Allbery

The instructions for contributing to OpenAFS have been revised for using
Git. These instructions are in the README.git file in each release.

The growl agent for Mac OS X is included in 1.5.73, but it's not well
integrated yet. Initial feedback is positive and testers are
welcome. Please send any feedback ot the port-darwin@openafs.org mailing
list.

A new version of the AFS PERL API was released. For more information and
downloads, go to [http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/kwiki/nog/afsperl/](http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/kwiki/nog/afsperl/)

Information Technology, University of West Bohemia.

## AFS Protocol Standardization

Informal drafts that haven't been uploaded to the IETF web site:

Rx Spec:

[http://openafs.sinenomine.net/~mmeffie/rfc/draft-zeldovich-rx-spec-00.html](http://openafs.sinenomine.net/~mmeffie/rfc/draft-zeldovich-rx-spec-00.html)

This draft is in the very early stages. Mike Meffie and Tom Keiser are the
current owners of this proposal. Nickolai Zeldovich wrote the original
draft. Mike and Tom have started updating the draft with Nickolai's
permission. A formal specification of Rx is needed for a basis for other
IETF proposals.

Discussion on these proposals is welcome and should be done on the
AFS3-standardization list at
[http://michigan-openafs-lists.central.org/mailman/listinfo/afs3-standardization](http://michigan-openafs-lists.central.org/mailman/listinfo/afs3-standardization)

### PTS Alternate Authentication

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-brashear-afs3-pts-extended-names](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-brashear-afs3-pts-extended-names)

Status: Active - Third call for review

Last Update: November 18, 2009

Expires: May 22, 2010

### AFS Callback Extensions

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-benjamin-extendedcallbackinfo](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-benjamin-extendedcallbackinfo)

Status: Active - Waiting on RPC refresh

This proposal will be rewritten with references to the RPC time refresh.

Last update: September 23, 2009

Expires: March 23, 2010

### DNS SRV Resource Records for AFS

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-allbery-afs-srv-records](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-allbery-afs-srv-records)

Status: Submitted to IETF

Still in the RFC Editor queue, waiting for them to have a chance to work
on it.

\--Russ

### RXGK

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilkinson-afs3-rxgk](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilkinson-afs3-rxgk)

Status: Active

Rxgk is a security layer for AFS which will support strong encryption and
authentication through Kerberos v5, GSI and any other GSSAPI security
mechanism.

Changes which are considered suitable for the 1.5.x series are in git -
look for changes with author sxw@your-file-system.com. A development tree,
which will be frequently rebased, is at
http://github.com/your-file-system/openafs-rxgk

Last Update: Jan 9, 2010

### AFS3 ACL Rights

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-deason-afs3-acl-restrictions](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-deason-afs3-acl-restrictions)

Status: Second draft

Last update: Jan 13, 2010

See the Per-File ACLs section for more info.

### Rx Security Object Providing Cleartext Peer Identity Assertions

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-rxrpc-sec-clear](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-rxrpc-sec-clear)

Status: Second draft

Last Update: February 1, 2010

The Rx clear security class will improve on the rxnull security object by
eliminating certain race conditions related to IPv4 address changes.  A
\-02 revision of this internet draft will be forthcoming in the next few
days, which will update the introduction and security considerations
sections of the memo.  Everyone is invited to review this document, and
comments should be sent to the afs3-standardization@grand.central.org
mailing list.

### AFSVol Tag-Length-Value Remote Procedure Call Extensions

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-afs3-volser-tlv](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-afs3-volser-tlv)

Status: Second Draft

Last Update: April 6, 2010

As new forms of metadata are added to AFS volumes, we are running into
limitations with the wire volume metadata structures used by the volume
server.  This internet draft aims to standardize a tag-length-value (TLV)
encoding for arbitrary AFS volume metadata.  A new version of this draft
was released on April 6th, 2010.  Everyone is invited to review and
comment on this document.  Comments should be sent to the
afs3-standardization@grand.central.org mailing list.

\--Tom

## Projects

### Demand-Attach FileServer (DAFS)

Project Contacts:

- Andrew Deason <adeason@sinenomine.net>
- Tom Keiser <tkeiser@sinenomine.net>
- Mike Meffie <mmeffie@sinenomine.net>

Gerrit 1406 (per-volume locks) has been merged along with the related
changes, and thus we can now salvage at the same time as volume
operations as well as other salvages. Gerrit 1092 is unfortunately still
not merged; we encourage additional review from anyone who can. Current
DAFS development involves adding background I/O threads to the salvager
code, and later making demand-salvages spawn as threads instead of
processes. Code for that should be available shortly.

\--Andrew

### Better Documentation

Project Contacts:

- Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>
- Jason Edgecombe <jason@rampaginggeek.com>

Davor Ocelic is working on writing man pages for the new demand-attach
binaries that aren't yet documented.  The man page for state\_analyzer has
been committed.



### Pthreaded Ubik

Project Contact:

- Steven Jenkins <steven.jenkins@gmail.com>
- Andrew Deason <adeason@sinenomine.net>
- Alistair Ferguson <Alistair.Ferguson@morganstanley.com>

Gerrit 1546 (add locks for addresses and cheader) has been submitted for
review, and with that, we now believe the vlserver to be thread-safe.
Since the vlserver thread-safety issues were the only known pthreaded ubik
issues, after 1546 we are aware of no further issues with pthreaded ubik.

\--Steven

We're still discussing what solution to use in gerrit 1546 (add locks
for the vldb ubik cache). Additional problems affecting pthreaded ubik
were found and fixed in gerrit 1680 (kill afs\_inet\_ntoa) and 1681
(correct use of flags\_cond and version\_cond).

\--Andrew

This project will likely be dropped as a separate project in a couple of
issues of the newsletter when this project is fully merged into the
mainline OpenAFS code.

### Kerberos v5 and multiple encryption types

Project Contacts:

- Matt Benjamin <matt@linuxbox.com>
- Marcus Watts <mwd@umich.edu>

I was hoping to have some time this week - got distracted by other
matters.  I do have one change of interest: the "tokens expired" message
which formerly looked like this:

    Feb 22 10:23:08 lancashire kernel: afs: Tokens for user of AFS id 555 for cell cats.umich.edu expired now

(where 555 was a fixed constant because the cache manager doesn't know
what viceid the user has), now looks like this:

    Apr 3 04:55:37 lancashire kernel: afs: Tokens for mdw@CATS.UMICH.EDU for cell cats.umich.edu expired now

I think that's an improvement.

Heimdal has some annoying weirdness with key types and checksums.
In 1.3.1 (at least,) the verify checksum logic insists only one
checksum algorithm is acceptable per key type.  The standards documents
do not forbid this interpetation, but don't exactly require it.
Sorting out acceptable checksum algorithms between various kerberos
distributions continues to be a problem.

I'm hoping to do a code drop soon.  It will probably be a complete
copy of source not just diffs.  I was overly aggressive about fixing
tabs and now have to "undo" some fixes to patches.  Blech.

\--Marcus

### Per-File ACLs

Project Contacts:

- Marc Dionne <marc.c.dionne@gmail.com>

Current status:

- I plan to give a talk on the topic at the upcoming workshop

\--Marc

### Mac OS X OpenAFS Preference Pane

Project Contact:

- Claudio Bisegni <Claudio.Bisegni@lnf.infn.it>

The preference pane has been updated to allow the renewal of Kerberos
tickets. The GUI and afs backgrounder were updated to accomodate this
change.

\--Claudio

### \*BSD Support

Project Contacts:

- Matt Benjamin <matt@linuxbox.com>

Commit 028240329c09b6a311cb85736f41d75f7ee7a01f deals with some updated VFS calls in FreeBSD.

### Userspace cache manager

Project Contact:

- Andrew Deason <adeason@sinenomine.net>

I've finally managed to find time to work on this again, resulting in
gerrit changes 1714-1726 which give a FUSE OpenAFS/libuafs client.
Functionality improvements over previous libuafs code include fixed
support for AFSDB and fakestat. Support will be forthcoming for some
pioctl operations (lsmount, rmmount, getacl, setacl, checkservers) and
perl SWIG bindings.

I will be presenting at AFSBPW 2010 about libuafs, on its potential uses
and how to use it.

\--Andrew

### S3 Front-end for AFS

Project Contacts:

- Fabrizio Manfredi <fabrizio.manfredi@gmail.com>
- Claudio Bisegni <Claudio.Bisegni@lnf.infn.it>

We have a generic implementation in alpha test, without authentication
and specific AFS ACL support. We hope to release a first public beta at
the end of the April ( without authentication).

\--Fabrizio

### Virtual Machine Images

Project Contact:

- Fabrizio Manfredi <fabrizio.manfredi@gmail.com>

The Virtual Machine Images are updated, now the operating system is Centos
5.4 with openafs 1.4.12, in the new distribution is also present the AFS
perl API with example scripts. If you want, you can downgrade to openafs
1.4.11 with a simple snapshot rollback.  The images are in vmware format
only, you can download from:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/s3afs/files/openafs-1.4.12-vm

\--Fabrizio

### Google Summer of Code 2010

Google will be doing their Summer of Code again in 2010.  We're proud to
announce that for the third year, OpenAFS will be participating as a
mentoring organization.

\--Simon

Accepted student proposals will be announced on April 26.
