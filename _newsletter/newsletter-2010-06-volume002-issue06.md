# OpenAFS Newsletter, Volume 2, Issue 6, June 2010

Welcome to the June issue of the OpenAFS newsletter. This newsletter
summarizes what is happening in the OpenAFS community.

As always, volunteers, patches, bug reports, or any other type of help is
greatly appreciated.

A new section is starting for case studies. Each issue of the newsletter
will feature one organization using OpenAFS. This new section is aimed to
give a high-level overview of how many different sites use OpenAFS. Thanks
go out to everyone who gave feedback on which questions to ask when
profiling an AFS site.

Feedback on this newsletter is welcome. The goal is to summarize the
various development efforts and news of OpenAFS for the community. Please
let Jason Edgecombe <jason@rampaginggeek.com> know what you would like to
see out of this newsletter. Any news about AFS-related projects is welcome
and may be submitted to Jason for inclusion in the next newsletter.

The current and past issues of this newsletter are available at
[http://www.openafs.org/newsletter/](http://www.openafs.org/newsletter/)

## General OpenAFS Progress

1.4.12.1 was released on May 25. This was a minor bug fix release to
support Linux 2.6.34, fix a Mac OS issue, and fix a panic. You may stick
with 1.4.12 if you aren't having any issues.

The beginning of a TAP test harness has been added to git.

The driving feature for the 1.6 release is the Demand-Attached File
Server. The 1.6 branch will be created when the DAFS bugs have been fixed
and tested.

## Case Study - Creedon Engineering

In this issue, I would like thank Ted Creedon of Creedon Engineering for
being the first organization to be profiled in the newsletter. --Jason

Jason: What is the name of your organization?

Ted: Creedon Engineering, Lake Oswego, Oregon

Jason: What does it do?

Ted: Electrical/Mechanical Consulting Engineers and software/hardware
engineering. Cyber security..

I frequently travel to remote Alaska, hence the need for AFS

Jason: So Creedon Engineering is located in Lake Oswego, Oregon, USA,
correct?

Ted: Yes

Jason: You are a one-man shop. Correct?

Ted: Yes

Jason: Do you use sub-contractors?

Ted: Yes

Jason: If you use contractors, do they use your AFS space?

Ted: No but in a large project they would

Jason: How many users does your site have?

Ted: 1

Jason: How many cells do you have?

Ted: 1

Jason: How many full-time and part-time people are responsible for AFS support
and in what capacity?

Ted: .0001

Jason: How much data do you store in AFS?

Ted: 500 GB

Jason: How do you use OpenAFS?

Ted: triple server redundant archival backup of irreplaceable photos and
engineering data with world wide secure access from low bandwidth lines.

Jason: You said "low-bandwidth", are you using dial-up, cellular phone
data network, or something more exotic, like satellite?

Ted: I was stuck with 128K out in the Aleutians but its been some time (5
years) since my last experiment.

Jason: How many servers do you have?

Ted: 4 in my office, sometimes more, never less than 3.

Jason: Are they in different locations?

Ted: No, but 2 should relocated.

Jason: How far apart are they?

Ted: Same room - which is bad but I need to get my spare UPS installed in
my home basement.

Jason: Your customer base is spread out. Which states?

Ted: I practice mainly in Alaska

Jason: Do you have customers in Canada or
outside the US?

Ted: No

Jason: Do you work on crude oil or mining equipment?

Ted: Yes, both the BP oil rig at NorthStar and the Red Dog Mine both in
Alaska. Both done in 1996-1998.  Note, any future work would include a task
to set up AFS in my proposal.

Jason: Do you use any other network storage to supplement AFS, like dropbox, or
windows shares?

Ted: Absolutely not, except for ftp - and I used ftp because of the
difficulty and time constraints of setting up AFS clients in Fairbanks.

2 years ago I was stuck with a packaged sftp program used in a very large
consulting firm (24,000 employees, 1,000 world wide offices) and my
project was sabotaged by the internal/external ftp site. AFS would have
been ideal but with an idiot based IT department, made it impossible to
implement.

If you can believe it, transmitting AutoCAD data in that corporate
environment was very primitive - to the point where productivity and
drawing/specification writing is measurably affected - my guess is by 25%
\- not to mention folks working in different offices working on the wrong
set of drawing revisions.

One issue is that tokens would be set up for 1 month lifetime. The users
are in the Construction business, not sophisticated.

Jason: Is AFS the only networked filesystem that you use?

Ted: Yes, but occasionally a shared drive

Jason: If not, what are the others, and how do they compare/contrast?

Ted: windows shares and/or samba are a pain and are insecure, also lack
backup capability.

Jason: Why do you use the other filesystems?

Ted: convenience - but rarely

Jason: Is your investment in AFS increasing or decreasing?

Ted: stable, unless you consider making new drivers/kernels an investment..

AFS is perfect for the traveling  "Road Warrior"..  And I don't have to
worry about military photos  and financial data  security.



## Events

### Annual Best Practices Workshop

The Seventh Annual International AFS & Kerberos Best Practices Workshop
was held May 24-28 at the University of Illinois. Participants enjoyed
socialising in the evenings after spending their days learning and sharing
experiences. In addition to the usual tutorials, 2 and a half days of
presentations followed, including Phillip Moore's keynote, "Global
Filesystems in the Real World: Comparing experiences with AFS and
NFS". Phil contrasted his previous work with AFS to his current work with
the OpenEFS system that runs on top of NFS now but could be used above
OpenAFS.

Other talks included topics such as tools, development, deployment,
debugging, and the future of OpenAFS.

Slides for the talks are available linked from
http://workshop.openafs.org/afsbpw10/schedule.html

### European AFS Conference

The date for the 3rd European AFS & Kerberos Conference has been set. The
conference will take place in Pilsen, Czech Republic, from September 13 to
September 15, 2010. More details are forthcoming and will be posted at
[http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz](http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz). The conference is being hosted by Centre for
Information Technology, University of West Bohemia.

The first Call for Participation has been announced. Please see
[http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz/cfp.php](http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz/cfp.php) for more information.

## AFS Protocol Standardization

Informal drafts that haven't been uploaded to the IETF web site:

Rx Spec:

[http://openafs.sinenomine.net/~mmeffie/rfc/draft-zeldovich-rx-spec-00.html](http://openafs.sinenomine.net/~mmeffie/rfc/draft-zeldovich-rx-spec-00.html)

This draft is in the very early stages. Mike Meffie and Tom Keiser are the
current owners of this proposal. A formal specification of Rx is needed as
a basis for other IETF proposals.

Discussion on these proposals is welcome and should be done on the
AFS3-standardization list at
[http://michigan-openafs-lists.central.org/mailman/listinfo/afs3-standardization](http://michigan-openafs-lists.central.org/mailman/listinfo/afs3-standardization)

### PTS Alternate Authentication

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-brashear-afs3-pts-extended-names](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-brashear-afs3-pts-extended-names)

Status: Third Draft

draft-brashear-afs3-pts-extended-names continues to be available for
review. The only outstanding comment involves a typo ("which which").

\--Derrick Brashear

### AFS Callback Extensions

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-benjamin-extendedcallbackinfo](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-benjamin-extendedcallbackinfo)

Status: Active - Waiting on RPC refresh

Extended callback implmementations for Unix and Windows have been
submitted to gerrit and have received initial review.  Ideally this code
will soon be able to merge, after branch for 1.6.  It's expected that its
rpc refresh dependencies will be resolvable at that point.

\--Matt Benjamin

### RXGK

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilkinson-afs3-rxgk](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilkinson-afs3-rxgk)

Status: Active

Rxgk is a security layer for AFS which will support strong encryption and
authentication through Kerberos v5, GSI and any other GSSAPI security
mechanism.

Changes which are considered suitable for the 1.5.x series are in git -
look for changes with author sxw@your-file-system.com. A development tree,
which will be frequently rebased, is at
http://github.com/your-file-system/openafs-rxgk

Last Update: Jan 9, 2010

### AFS3 ACL Rights

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-deason-afs3-acl-restrictions](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-deason-afs3-acl-restrictions)

Status: Second draft

Last update: January 13, 2010

See the Per-File ACLs section for more info.

### Rx Security Object Providing Cleartext Peer Identity Assertions

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-rxrpc-sec-clear](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-rxrpc-sec-clear)

Status: Third draft

Last Update: April 17, 2010

I released a new version of the Rx Clear security class I-D the other
day.  I am hereby soliciting comments on this new version of the
draft.

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-rxrpc-sec-clear](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-rxrpc-sec-clear)

The major changes in this version of the document are:

- new introductory section that better explains the relationship
between Rx and AFS-3 so that the document is more approachable for
novices
- additional prose in the security considerations section which better
explains how this security object changes the attack vectors, as well
as a brief mention of securing rxnull/rxclear with IPsec
- flesh out the AFS assigned numbers registrar section with formal
specifications for each newly requested registry
- change the endpoint identifier type enumeration from 32-bits to
8-bits, as the larger size seemed quite wasteful
- mark several security header fields as reserved for future use
- I added a number of informative references to Transarc and CMU ITC
tech reports

\--Tom

### AFSVol Tag-Length-Value Remote Procedure Call Extensions

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-afs3-volser-tlv](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-afs3-volser-tlv)

Status: Second Draft

Last Update: April 6, 2010

As new forms of metadata are added to AFS volumes, we are running into
limitations with the wire volume metadata structures used by the volume
server.  This internet draft aims to standardize a tag-length-value (TLV)
encoding for arbitrary AFS volume metadata.  A new version of this draft
was released on April 6th, 2010.  Everyone is invited to review and
comment on this document.  Comments should be sent to the
afs3-standardization@grand.central.org mailing list.

\--Tom

### AFS Byte-Range File Locking

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mbenjamin-afs-file-locking](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-mbenjamin-afs-file-locking)

Status: Fifth Draft

This draft proposes protocol extensions to support byte-range and
mandatory locking.

The first draft was submitted on May 5, 2010.

## Projects

### Demand-Attach FileServer (DAFS)

Project Contacts:

- Andrew Deason <adeason@sinenomine.net>
- Tom Keiser <tkeiser@sinenomine.net>
- Mike Meffie <mmeffie@sinenomine.net>

An important fix from Simon in gerrit 1832 has been merged. Gerrit 1562
(ihandle positional I/O) is still being reviewed, but has made much
progress. The salvager threadsafe changes (gerrit 1865 and its
dependencies) are also still undergoing review, but have seen much recent
change. There is one remaining known DAFS bug involving saving and
restoring fileserver state that was mentioned at the workshop, but an
underlying cause is still being looked into.

\--Andrew

### Better Documentation

Project Contacts:

- Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>
- Jason Edgecombe <jason@rampaginggeek.com>

Many of the known deficiencies in the OpenAFS man pages have been fixed in
the current master branch, although some vos flags and backup commands are
not yet documented.  Two demand-attach binaries still need man pages.

The first chapter and part of the second chapter of the OpenAFS
Administration Guide have been revised.

### Userspace cache manager

Project Contact:

- Andrew Deason <adeason@sinenomine.net>

Immediately following the libuafs presentation I gave at BPW 2010, the
perl libuafs bindings were submitted in gerrit 2048 (and 2049). There are
still at least a couple of issues to work out: specifically PIC and
packaging issues. After resolving those, I expect the next big things to
be seen out of this are krb5 authentication support and python bindings,
if the BPW discussions are any indication. Thanks to all who listened to
my talk, and provided feedback.

\--Andrew

### Kerberos v5 and multiple encryption types

Project Contacts:

- Matt Benjamin <matt@linuxbox.com>
- Marcus Watts <mwd@umich.edu>

I'll be making a snapshot of openafs "m85" tonight (Ed: June 9), based exactly
on 1.5.61.  Next few goals will probably be:

- update to 1.5.74/75
- improve patch splitout process
- move to git(devel/temp)
- test on windows
- implement anonymous callback protection

\--Marcus Watts



### Google Summer of Code 2010

OpenAFS received five slots for the 2010 Google Summer of Code.

Go to [http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/org/home/google/gsoc2010/openafs](http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/org/home/google/gsoc2010/openafs)
for more information about the GSoC projects.

#### Unix Support for AppleDouble files (Posix Attributes)

Student Developer: Kelli Ireland <kelli.ireland@gmail.com>

Mentor: Derrick Brashear <shadow@gmail.com>

Self-intro:
[https://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-devel/2010-May/017582.html](https://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-devel/2010-May/017582.html)

Kelli Ireland (Derrick's student) kicked off the official start of the
GSoC program by attending the AFS/Kerberos workshop.  She is working
on extended attribute support, specifically for AppleDouble files (.\_
files, aka dot-underscore files).  She is currently working on a
dot-underscore file parser.

#### Encrypted Storage

Student Developer: Sanket Agarwal <sanket@sanketagarwal.com>

Mentor: Simon Wilkinson <sxw@inf.ed.ac.uk>

Self-intro:
[https://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-devel/2010-March/017424.html](https://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-devel/2010-March/017424.html)

Abstract:

The AFS protocol offers encryption for data transport from client to
server. However, that data is stored on the server in cleartext, where it
can potentially be read by the administrators of that server. This poses a
real world problem for organisations who wish to outsource the provision
of their file storage, whilst keeping their data confidential. This
project would augment the existing AFS client to support encrypting data
blocks before sending them to the file server.

#### Apply the kafs project of OpenAFS

Student Developer: Lei Wang <wang840925@gmail.com>

Mentor: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

Self-intro:
[https://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-devel/2010-April/017493.html](https://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-devel/2010-April/017493.html)

The progress of kafs project is good.  We have implemented part of the DNS
support for kafs sub-project.  We created a common module in the linux kernel
for handling the DNS queries, derived from code in the CIFS module.  It should
be finished in several days.

\--Lei

#### Port OpenAFS to NetBSD

Student Developer: Matt Smith <matt.j.sm@gmail.com>

Mentor: Matt Benjamin <matt@linuxbox.com>

Self-intro:
[https://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-devel/2010-March/017450.html](https://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-devel/2010-March/017450.html)

Current status is that I've rebased the NetBSD port at OpenBSD, with
various adaptations targeting NetBSD 4.x.  Matt S. is getting up to speed,
starting with work on the NetBSD LKM on NetBSD 5.0.2.

\--Matt Benjamin

#### An open source version of the Microsoft Safe String Library

Student Developer: Jonas Sundberg <jonas.sundberg@gmail.com>

Mentor: Jeffrey Altman <jaltman@secure-endpoints.com>

Self-intro:
[https://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-devel/2010-May/017602.html](https://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-devel/2010-May/017602.html)

Work is progressing a bit ahead of the proposed timeline. Both standard
and wide character versions of Cat, CatN, Copy, CopyN and Length are all
implemented and have some unit testing for the basic functionality. Wide
character versions of the functions were more similar to the standard
character versions than I had expected, so much of that work has already
been done ahead of time. Initial untested drafts of Gets, Printf and
VPrintf have also been implemented.

The things to do next will be to extend the tests to cover the new
functions and working on implementing the extended versions of all
functions, as well as unit tests for these.

\--Jonas
