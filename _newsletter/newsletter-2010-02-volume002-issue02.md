# OpenAFS Newsletter, Volume 2, Issue 2, February 2010

Welcome to the tenth issue of the OpenAFS newsletter. This newsletter
summarizes what is happening in the OpenAFS community.

As always, volunteers, patches, bug reports, or any other type of help is
greatly appreciated.

Feedback on this newsletter is welcome. The goal is to summarize the
various development efforts and news of OpenAFS for the community. Please
let Jason Edgecombe <jason@rampaginggeek.com> know what you would like to
see out of this newsletter. Any news about AFS-related projects is welcome
and may be submitted to Jason for inclusion in the next newsletter.

The current and past issues of this newsletter are available at
[http://www.openafs.org/newsletter/](http://www.openafs.org/newsletter/)

## General OpenAFS Progress

There were two OpenAFS releases on February 1st. One was 1.5.71, and the
other was 1.4.12rc2. Due to some late breaking Linux issues with 1.5.71,
using that version on Linux is discouraged. Testing of 1.4.12rc2 and
future 1.5.x versions on all platforms is encouraged. Please report any
bugs.

Some questions about the timeline of IPv6 came up. IPv6 is part of the
RxTCP project which is planned for implementation in 2011. See
[http://www.openafs.org/roadmap.html](http://www.openafs.org/roadmap.html) for more details.

## Events

### Annual Best Practices Workshop

Plans are already underway for the seventh Workshop, to be held May 24-28,
2010, at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  We hope to see
you there.

Web site: [http://workshop.openafs.org/afsbpw10/index.html](http://workshop.openafs.org/afsbpw10/index.html)

### European AFS Conference

The date for the 3rd European AFS & Kerberos Conference has been set. The
conference will take place in Pilsen, Czech Republic, from September 13 to
September 15, 2010. More details are forthcoming and will be posted at
[http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz](http://afs2010.civ.zcu.cz). The conference is being hosted by Centre for
Information Technology, University of West Bohemia.

## AFS Protocol Standardization

Informal drafts that haven't been uploaded to the IETF web site:

Rx Spec:

[http://openafs.sinenomine.net/~mmeffie/rfc/draft-zeldovich-rx-spec-00.html](http://openafs.sinenomine.net/~mmeffie/rfc/draft-zeldovich-rx-spec-00.html)

Discussion on these proposals is welcome and should be done on the
AFS3-standardization list at
[http://michigan-openafs-lists.central.org/mailman/listinfo/afs3-standardization](http://michigan-openafs-lists.central.org/mailman/listinfo/afs3-standardization)

### PTS Alternate Authentication

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-brashear-afs3-pts-extended-names](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-brashear-afs3-pts-extended-names)

Status: Active - Third call for review

Third call for review; I'm gonna ask for a last call later in the
month as so far all review comment has been incorporated, unless
something comes up.

\--Derrick Brashear

### AFS Callback Extensions

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-benjamin-extendedcallbackinfo](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-benjamin-extendedcallbackinfo)

Status: Active - Needs more discussion

We need to decide whether we're going to wait for the RPC refresh changes
before publishing extended callbacks. My belief is that that's the only
factor currently delaying this document. The question here, essentially,
is whether anyone would deploy extended callbacks before deploying updated
RPCs. To date, nobody has said they would do so.

\--Simon Wilkinson

### DNS SRV Resource Records for AFS

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-allbery-afs-srv-records](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-allbery-afs-srv-records)

Status: Submitted to IETF

Last call will complete on February 5th, after which (probably the next
weekend), I'll upload a new version of the draft.  At that point, the
document will go forward to the IESG for review and approval (possibly
after futher changes).

I have read and responded to all of the Last Call feedback received.  The
changes due to the Last Call feedback are mostly minor.  Various people
reviewing the document would have liked to have a reference to the AFS
protocol specification.  I think we all agree that it would be lovely to
have such a thing!

### RXGK

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilkinson-afs3-rxgk](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-wilkinson-afs3-rxgk)

Status: Active

Rxgk is a security layer for AFS which will support strong encryption and
authentication through Kerberos v5, GSI and any other GSSAPI security
mechanism.

Documents describing rxgk have been published and are being discussed on
the afs3-standardization list. To date, no major objections have been
raised in both public, and private, review.

Implementation work on rxgk has commenced - this is proceeding in a number
of parallel tracks:

- 1

Changes are being made to the OpenAFS code base to support multiple
security layers - these changes will aid the integration of both rxgk and
any other new RX security mechanism. These are being submitted to
OpenAFS's gerrit as they occur, and are already being merged into the
development tree - look for commits by sxw@your-file-system.com if you
wish to track these.

- 2

A new cryptography framework for OpenAFS is being developed. Whilst we
are keen to avoid using our own cryptography code, in some situations such
as the kernel, we have no choice. So, the intention is to provide a
multi-layered cryptography framework where each layer can be replaced with
native routines. As a foundation, we will be using Heimdal's libcrypto
library to provide a set of EVP-style functions to the rest of the OpenAFS
code. We will use this in the kernel, and where a compatible library is
not available in userspace. On top of this, we will provide a library
offering RFC3961 style encryption functions. The current intention is to
base this on Heimdal's crypto.c. rxgk will then be built on top of this
library.

- 3

rxgk itself is being implemented on top of this base. An initial
implementation of the key negotiation mechanism is complete, and work has
commenced on writing the block encryption layer.

\--Simon

### AFS3 ACL Rights

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-deason-afs3-acl-restrictions](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-deason-afs3-acl-restrictions)

Status: Second draft

Andrew Deason has published an IETF draft to provide a common document for
discussion of the proposed new ACL rights to prevent users with admin
rights on a folder from giving rights to system:anyuser.

### Rx Security Object Providing Cleartext Peer Identity Assertions

[http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-rxrpc-sec-clear](http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tkeiser-rxrpc-sec-clear)

Status: BCP

There are a number of anonymous RxRPC applications which require identity
assertions in order to ensure that the desired peer receives and processes
the procedure call.  This memo defines a replacement for the rxnull
security class which provides a means for mutually agreeing upon who is
communicating, without incurring cryptographic overhead.  It should be
noted that, much like rxnull, this security object is not suitable for use
in a distributed environment due to its inability to provide integrity
protection.

## Projects

### Demand-Attach FileServer (DAFS)

Project Contacts:

- Andrew Deason <adeason@sinenomine.net>
- Tom Keiser <tkeiser@sinenomine.net>
- Mike Meffie <mmeffie@sinenomine.net>

Performance improvements are being worked on in gerrit 1092 (parallel
preattach optimization) and gerrit 880 (volume group cache). 1092 is
nearly done (just undergoing review) while 880 needs some more work on
the underlying lock work (gerrit 1237). Development documentation has
begun to emerge, starting with FSSYNC docs (gerrit 1236).

\--Andrew

### Better Documentation

Project Contacts:

- Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>
- Jason Edgecombe <jason@rampaginggeek.com>

Simon Wilkinson added the -files and -excessive options to the
fs\_getcacheparms man page and updated the man pages and XML documentation
to reflect that new versions don't perform a weekly restart of the
bosserver. Asanka Herath fixed a typo in the Admin guide.

### Pthreaded Ubik

Project Contact:

- Steven Jenkins <steven.jenkins@gmail.com>
- Andrew Deason <adeason@sinenomine.net>

Pthreaded ubik now compiles again on master without warnings. While
there are no known issues with pthreaded ubik itself at this point,
portions of the vlserver code are known not to be threadsafe. Work is
ongoing on making the vlserver threadsafe and thus safe to use with
pthreaded ubik.

\--Andrew

### Kerberos v5 and multiple encryption types

Project Contacts:

- Matt Benjamin <matt@linuxbox.com>
- Marcus Watts <mwd@umich.edu>

rxk5 test environment -> upgraded.

build logic for openafs -> fixes so can now build "out of tree".

Now looking at kerberos integration issues.

The plan is to deliver "separated" patches around may.  Patches will be
against some recent version of openafs as of that time.

\--Marcus

### Disconnected AFS support

Project Contacts:

- Simon Wilkinson <sxw@inf.ed.ac.uk>
- Dragos Tatulea <dragos.tatulea@gmail.com>

Simon started some discussion on the afs3-standardization list about
adding a VL\_WhoAmI RPC to aid with reconstructing ACL's in disconnected
mode.

### Per-File ACLs

Project Contacts:

- Marc Dionne <marc.c.dionne@gmail.com>

I did some work on it last summer which included a basic working
prototype, and there has also been some discussion of the expected
semantics, compatibility and implementation issues.

I'm proposing to do a talk on the subject at the next workshop, and hope
to revive the issue and move it forward in the meantime by trying to get
some consensus on the expected semantics, formalising the protocol
changes, and make progress on the coding front.

\--Marc
