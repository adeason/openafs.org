#### 2009-07-09 - OpenAFS Changes Source Code Version Control System to Git

After more than eighteen months of attempts to migrate source code
management away from cvs OpenAFS has finally converted to Git. This
change will not have any visible impact on end users. For developers
there are major changes in the tools required to work with the OpenAFS
source repository and the workflow used to submit contributions to
OpenAFS. Along with the conversion to Git, OpenAFS is now using the
Gerrit source code review application which makes it significantly
easier for developers to review and comment on each other's
contributions.
