Once again, Google will be doing their Summer of Code. For the first
year, OpenAFS will be participating as a mentoring organization.
Students interested are encouraged to discuss potential projects on the
openafs development list. We have a list of [suggested projects](gsoc.html)
online, but we would be happy to discuss any relevant project with you.
