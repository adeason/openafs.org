#### 2013-07-24 - SECURITY RELEASES - OpenAFS 1.4.15, 1.6.5 and 1.7.26 available

With the release of OpenAFS security advisories 2013-003 and 2013-004,
we have released OpenAFS 1.6 and 1.7 versions with code to address the
issues disclosed. Additionally, 1.4.15 has been released to address
advisory 2013-003, but not 2013-004. 1.4.15 is expected to be the final
release in the 1.4 series.

We recommend all sites update their servers immediately, following the
documentation about how to install the new binaries and rekey your
servers.
