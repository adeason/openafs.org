OpenAFS 1.4.14 NOT vulnerable    CVE-2011-0431, while correctly
describing 1.4.14 as containing the fix for this issue, describes in its
summary the release as broken. It is not. We recommend sites upgrade to
1.4.14; However, the impact of the issue is limited to a denial of
service attack by a user with the ability to affect a lock of AFS though
the client on a host.
