#### 2006-12-28 - OpenAFS Elders announce "No More DES" roadmap

AFSv3 was designed and implemented during the late 80s and early 90s
when the state of the art in distributed computer authentication and
data confidentiality was to use Kerberos 4 and the United States' Data
Encryption Standard (DES). Over the last two years the U.S. National
Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) has withdrawn the DES
standard and MIT has announced the end of life of Kerberos 4. In
response, the OpenAFS Elders have approved a roadmap to transition from
DES to stronger ciphers which includes the deprecation of the OpenAFS
kaserver.
