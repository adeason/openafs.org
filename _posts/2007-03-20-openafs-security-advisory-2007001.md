#### 2007-03-20 - OpenAFS Security Advisory 2007-001

Unix clients in OpenAFS versions before 1.5.17 and 1.4.4 allow a
potential privilege escalation via setuid functionality which can be
enabled by the client administration but is enabled by default for the
client's local cell. To avoid this issue, 1.5.17 and 1.4.4 have been
issued with setuid disabled by default in all cases.
