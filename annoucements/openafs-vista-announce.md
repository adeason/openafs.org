title: Announcing OpenAFS Works with Windows Vista
---

1 December 2006

The OpenAFS Elders are pleased to announce that with the release of
[OpenAFS for Windows version
1.5.12](http://www.openafs.org/windows.html) that [Microsoft Windows
Vista](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/) becomes an officially
supported platform. All versions of Vista including "Home Basic", "Home
Premium", "Business", and "Ultimate" are supported on both X86 and
X86\_64 CPU architectures.

The OpenAFS for Windows 1.5.12 release is the result of more than a year
of close cooperation between the OpenAFS Gatekeepers and the Microsoft
Windows Vista team. It is not a stretch to say that OpenAFS on Vista
could not have been completed without the assistance of Microsoft's
development staff and that Windows Vista would not be as solid and
backward compatible an operating system without the regression reports
filed by the OpenAFS community. The OpenAFS community filed reports that
improved the quality not only of OpenAFS but also the Windows Explorer
Shell, the Windows Networking stack, and the Windows File System.

Microsoft has granted OpenAFS for Windows 1.5.12 use of the "Works with
Windows Vista" logo which indicates that OpenAFS for Windows 1.5.12 and
its future derivatives are compatible with the Microsoft Windows Vista
family of operating systems.

OpenAFS for Windows 1.5.12 provides all of the functionality users have
learned to expect from OpenAFS on Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003
SP1. In many respects, the performance of OpenAFS for Windows when run
on Windows Vista surpasses that found on Windows XP SP2 or Windows
Server 2003 SP1 due to performance optimizations within the Windows
Vista CIFS client.

Other improvements in OpenAFS for Windows 1.5.12 include the
incorporation of a new Network Identity Manager AFS credential module
for use with MIT's Kerberos for Windows 3.1. This module provides end
users with a powerful mechanism by which the acquisition and renewal of
AFS tokens for multiple AFS cells from a single Kerberos 5 principal can
be automated.

Future plans for OpenAFS for Windows include:

-   Improved support for the Windows Vista User Account Control security
    feature
-   A new OpenAFS Control Panel for managing the user's AFS experience
    including AFS Protection Service Groups
-   A new OpenAFS Microsoft Management Console (MMC) for configuring the
    AFS Client Service
-   Support for Unicode file and directory names
-   An integrated off-line folder functionality that does not rely on
    the Windows CIFS client
-   Replacement of the AFS SMB gateway implementation with a native
    Windows file system driver.
-   Support for multiple data streams that are used for the storage of
    meta data that can be used to improve search and security functions
    in Windows Vista.
-   Implementation of AFS Servers (File, Protection, Volume Database) on
    Windows Vista.

OpenAFS is an open source project whose future is bright. End user and
grant organizations that wish to contribute to the future development of
OpenAFS on Windows Vista or other platforms are encouraged to:
