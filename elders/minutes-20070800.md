title: OpenAFS Monthly Newsletter – August 2007
---

*A Monthly Update to the OpenAFS Community compiled by the Advisory
Council*

Introduction
============

This is the first of what is intended to be a monthly communiqué from
the OpenAFS Elders to the community of OpenAFS administrators and end
users.  In these newsletters the Elders will summarize the activities of
the OpenAFS community, the progress that has been achieved in OpenAFS
development, and outline the road map of future development that could
be accomplished with the availability of sufficient resources. It is
hoped that these newsletters will strengthen the community and foster
additional dialogues and participation.

Advisory Council Meeting
========================

The OpenAFS Advisory Council met on June 26.  The following topics were
discussed in the meeting:  Development, AFS & Kerberos Best Practices
Workshop, Web Site Design, and OpenAFS communications.  Minutes of the
meeting can be found at:

Recent Releases
=================

### UNIX, Linux & MacOS X Development

The following have been areas of recent activity for OpenAFS on UNIX and
MacOS X: 
-   Integration work on rxgk with Love Hörnquist Åstrand.
-   Continued integration work on demand attach fileserver with updates
    form Tom Keiser.
-   Merging of advancements from Community, including fixes for AIX 5.3,
    Solaris 10+, and MacOS 10.4.  (The next release will also include
    detection for network changes in MacOS 10.4).
-   Patches are almost ready for a 1.4.5pre1.
-   There is a bug remaining in the file server in 1.5.x which still
    needs to be resolved.  When this is done, we will start to consider
    stable releases for the 1.6 series.
-   There is also some work ongoing on the disk cache.
-   There has been a lot of activity around the Debian packages. 
    Several patches have been committed, after verification on Zephyr. 
-   There are several fixes for Linux required on 1.4.4, and 1.4.5 will
    be going out soon.

### Microsoft Windows Development

We have issued five releases of OpenAFS for Windows in the past three
months: 
-   1.5.16 - DST updates
-   1.5.17 - Improved NAT behavior
-   1.5.18 - Minor bug fixes
-   1.5.19 - Denial of Service vulnerability; many integrated logon
    improvements
-   1.5.20 - drop boxes; automatic fake stat when the user has no read
    privileges
-   1.5.21 – significant performance optimizations

AFS & Kerberos Best Practices Workshop
--------------------------------------

The AFS & Kerberos Best Practices Workshop was held at SLAC from May
7-11.  The keynote was entitled "AFS Best Practices in the Business
Context" and was given by Mike Potek of Pictage, Inc.  Mike provided a
compelling story of AFS usage within a global business whose distributed
storage is growing at a very rapid rate.  \

Most of the presentations (including the keynote presentation) from the
workshop can be found at:

The "OpenAFS for Windows and Kerberos for Windows User Interface
Futures" and "OpenAFS Road Map

Discussions" can be found at:

Web Site Design

The OpenAFS Elders have a machine up and running at Stanford which is
intended to be used for hosting a new customer focused web site. There
is still much work to do on content design.  Sine Nomine Associates has
offered to volunteer a graphic artist / web designer.  However, before
this resource can be effectively used, the Advisory Council needs to
develop the site content, navigation design and site mapping.

Documentation Improvement
-------------------------

There was discussion of the need for improvement of the OpenAFS
documentation during the Best Practices Workshop. Thanks to Simon
Wilkinson, the OpenAFS documentation is improving.  However, the manuals
still need quite a lot of cleanup.  If anyone is interested in helping
with this project, please contact Russ Allbery.

Case Study of the Month – Pictage, Inc.
--------------------------------------

[http://www.pictage.com/](http://www.pictage.com/)

Pictage is a worldwide provider of services to wedding photographers who
upload the photos they have taken. Pictage then makes the photos
available to the wedding party for photo selection and printing.  Photos
selected for printing are retouched by hand using Adobe Photoshop. 
Pictage uses OpenAFS to store all of the original photos, the processed
photos, and the web content.  Work flow is managed by the use of mount
points and symlinks which are placed within directories assigned to
various photographers and their associated events. 

Pictage storage has exceeded 200TB of data and more then 40 million
files.  They frequently push the limits of the AFS directory structures
running into the directory entry limitations.  Directory search
performance is one of their bottlenecks.  Unlike more modern file
systems, AFS does not use a B+ tree representation and directory
searches within the case-insensitive Microsoft Windows client are linear
in nature.  This wastes significant CPU utilization and clock time. 
Pictage had measured the performance loss on a duo-core Xeon processor
at between 3 and 5 seconds to open a file in Adobe Photoshop when the
directory contains 15,000 entries, because Adobe Photoshop will request
information forthe last 30 files it has seen, thus requiring heavy usage
of AFS directories.   OpenAFS for Windows 1.5.13 added an optimization
for cached files with registered callbacks that avoids the performance
problem for files that are known to exist.  With this optimization in
place, Pictage experienced file open times similar to those experienced
when opening files on the local filesystem.  For files that do not exist
such as Java class files, the optimization does not apply, and the
linear search must still be used. 

- Number of simultaneous users: 150 AFS client users; 1000 web server users 
- Amount of data in AFS: Approx 215TB 
- Amount of AFS storage: 265TB with planned growth to 425TB in twelve months 
- Number of volumes: Approx 800,000. 
- Number of files: Approx 200 000 000. 
- Number of file servers: 70 with 10 more planned
- Approx storage per server: depending on age of server 1.2TB to 25TB
