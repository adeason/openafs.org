## Support for OpenAFS ##

OpenAFS users have a range of paid and community-based options for obtaining support.

### Community Support ###

The OpenAFS community provides a number of free forums for obtaining assistance.

*   __The <openafs-info@openafs.org> mailing list__

    This mailing list is a general all-purpose forum for discussing any aspect
    of using and deploying OpenAFS.
    [Archives](http://lists.openafs.org/pipermail/openafs-info/) are available.
    It is open to all.

    [Subscribe](http://lists.openafs.org/mailman/listinfo/openafs-info) to the
    list before posting. Otherwise, your mail may get held in a moderator's
    queue for an extended period of time.

*   __Internet Relay Chat__

    A real time IRC forum is available in the [#openafs channel of
    Freenode](irc://freenode.net/openafs). If you would like to meet other
    OpenAFS users and interact in real time, this is often a good place to
    start.

*   __OpenAFS Bug Reporting__

    [Bug Reports](mailto:openafs-bugs@openafs.org?subject=Bug Report) and [Feature Requests](mailto:openafs-bugs@openafs.org?subject=Feature Request) may be filed with the development community.

    Open bugs and requests can be [reviewed in
